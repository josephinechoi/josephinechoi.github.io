### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was the first of favorites because it was the first time that I had actually ever coded C++. Although it was the shortest coding lab assignment compared to the others that we worked on after, it's still memorable since I learned the very basics of coding. Some basics included how to intialize variables, using NAN, return functions, etc. I also learned how to compile, git add, git commit, git push, etc.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was the second of my favorites since we have to come up with code in order to calculate the game of Blackjack. Looking back at the code, I was able to write many bool functions depending on the category of cards. THe fun part was testing whether the code worked by inputting numbers and letters that represented the cards and testing the calculations.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was the third of my favorites where we had to guess the number and it would respond with "Too high!" or "Too low!" if the guess was incorrect. I really like our coding labs that included a sort of interactive game. For this lab, I used multiple bool functions for the guesses, and also an if statement that said that if the person used up all the guesses, it would return over.
